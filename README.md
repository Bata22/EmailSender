This project contains a script for automating the process of sending emails. To use this script, create a `.env` file in the root directory and include the following variables:

## Main Components to Configure

- `PASS`: Your app password generated by Gmail for third-party app access.
- `SENDER`: Your email address from which the emails will be sent.
- `RECEIVER`: The target email address to which the emails will be sent.
- `BODY`: The text content of the email you wish to send.

### .env file example

```env

SENDER=youremail@example.com
RECEIVER=targetemail@example.com
BODY=Your email content here
```
